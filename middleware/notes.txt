Middleware:
Middleware in Express.js is like a helper function that 
does something with the incoming request before it 
reaches your final route handler. It can:

    Check or modify the request
    Add information to the request or response
    End the request-response process
    Pass control to the next function
For example, middleware can be used to log information about each request or check if a user is logged in.



Router:
Router in Express.js helps you organize your routes. Instead of putting all your routes in one big file, you can create separate route files. Each router file handles a specific set of routes, like user-related routes.

For example, you can have a router for handling user actions like login and profile views. Then, you use this router in your main app file to manage those routes.



MongoDB Integration:
When using MongoDB with Express.js:

    Middleware helps you handle and process data from requests (like converting JSON data).
    Routers help you organize and manage routes that interact with your MongoDB database.
